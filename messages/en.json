We are a project group called MindsUnited, currently participating in the Smart Solutions Semester project at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. Our interdisciplinary team consists of International Business and Nursing students. We are currently working on a project to raise awareness for the effective implementation of Advanced Care Planning for professionals working with dementia patients in the IJssel-Vecht region. We are part of the project in collaboration with the Windesheim University of Applied Sciences in Zwolle. We are working together with various clients and disciplines to emphasize the importance of Advanced Care Planning.",
  "home_text_4": "In the period from November to December, we are planning to hold a KICK-OFF meeting with various professionals, where the appropriate form of Advanced Care Planning will be presented. The exact content of this meeting is still to be determined. As a project group, we would like to generate interest in this event, as it will have great value for professionals.",
  "home_text_5": "What is proactive care planning? Advanced Care Planning involves making decisions about future medical care in the event that an individual is unable to communicate their preferences. It includes discussing preferences, values, and goals regarding medical treatments and documenting them in legal documents such as living wills or medical powers of attorney. This ensures that the received care aligns with the patient's personal preferences, even if they are unable to make decisions themselves. In this process, professionals collaborate to achieve the best care outcomes within this palliative phase for this target group."
