We are a project group called MindsUnited, currently participating in the Smart Solutions Semester project at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. Our interdisciplinary team consists of International Business and Nursing students. We are currently working on a project to raise awareness for the effective implementation of Advanced Care Planning for professionals working with dementia patients in the IJssel-Vecht region. We are part of the project in collaboration with the Windesheim University of Applied Sciences in Zwolle. We are working together with various clients and disciplines to emphasize the importance of Advanced Care Planning.",
  "home_text_4": "In the period from November to December, we are planning to hold a KICK-OFF meeting with various professionals, where the appropriate form of Advanced Care Planning will be presented. The exact content of this meeting is still to be determined. As a project group, we would like to generate interest in this event, as it will have great value for professionals.",
  "home_text_5": "Advanced Care Planning involves making decisions about future medical care in the event that an individual is unable to communicate their preferences. It includes discussing preferences, values, and goals regarding medical treatments and documenting them in legal documents such as living wills or medical powers of attorney. This ensures that the received care aligns with the patient's personal preferences, even if they are unable to make decisions themselves. In this process, professionals collaborate to achieve the best care outcomes within this palliative phase for this target group.",

And to do so in a more transmurally coordinated way about proactive care planning discussions and their outcomes. As a result, care and support will better meet the wishes and needs of people with dementia and their families throughout the dementia care process, from diagnosis to death.",
  "home_text_10": "This project was funded by our Palliance programme. This is our commitment to ensuring a good quality of life for terminally ill people and their families. This means receiving care and support that meets their wishes and needs. For people with dementia, this can sometimes be particularly challenging.

  "more_text_3": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts that the number of people dying annually worldwide will rise from 51 million in 2015 to 70 million in 2030. Due to improved diagnostics and treatment, people are living longer. People continue to live at home for longer and attention is being paid to the values, wishes and needs of patients and their loved ones. Their values, wishes and needs is what good palliative care is all about. We believe it is important that every citizen is assured of palliative care in the right place, at the right time and by the right healthcare providers. That is why we invest in optimising palliative care in physical, psychological, social and spiritual areas.",
  "more_text_4": "What is palliative care?",
  "more_text_5": "Palliative care is care for patients and their loved ones dealing with a life-threatening condition or frailty. This care improves the quality of life by preventing and relieving suffering. Having an eye for problems of a physical, psychological, social and spiritual nature is central. Early detection and careful assessment and treatment of those problems is essential. More information can be found in the Quality Framework for Palliative Care Netherlands, which forms the basis for the organisation of palliative care in the Netherlands.",
  "more_text_6": "Healthcare innovations and quality",
  "more_text_7": "We focus on underpinning existing interventions around symptom management, driving the implementation of promising interventions and encouraging quality improvement through learning and improvement in practice. Read more about quality indicators and learning and improvement.",

  "more_text_9": "We are committed to good cooperation and information transfer between parties involved in the care and support of patients in the palliative phase and their relatives. This mainly concerns transmural cooperation in 1st and 2nd line care, the connection with the social domain, the individual care plan and digital data exchange. Read more about cooperation and transfer.",
  "more_text_10": "Participation and support",
  "more_text_11": "There is a focus on supporting the patient, informal carer and carer. We also encourage research on how to support both in cases of overload, moral dilemmas and other issues. Read more about support care network.",

  "Dementia": "Dementia",
  "moretext2_1": "Dementia is an umbrella term for over 50 diseases, of which Alzheimer's disease is the best known. In the Netherlands, 1 in 5 people develop dementia. At ZonMw, we want to use knowledge and innovation to improve the quality of life for people with dementia and their loved ones.",
  "moretext2_2": "Types of dementia",
  "moretext2_3": "The most common types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia. In the diseases, nerve cells in the brain are damaged, causing them to malfunction and reduce their ability to process information. This affects memory, body and mental health.",
  "moretext2_4": "How does dementia occur?",
  "moretext2_5": "Much is unknown about the processes that lead to dementia. There is also often no 1 cause that can be identified. We therefore fund research into the origin and mechanism of dementia. This includes further identifying and understanding how genes, nerve cells, glial cells and proteins work. Unravelling the mechanisms may also ultimately help treat, diagnose or prevent dementia. We fund the MODEM consortium that brings together parties to better understand the origins of dementia.",
  "moretext2_6": "Better care, support and activities for people with dementia",
  "moretext2_7": "It is important that people with dementia and their loved ones can participate in our society and have a good quality of life. With the right care, support and activities, they stay active, healthy and socially engaged for longer by staying in touch with others. We focus on care and support for people with dementia, through our research programmes from the medical and social domain.",
  "moretext2_8": "When a person is diagnosed with dementia, the palliative phase begins. This phase lasts between six and eight years on average. In order to know what the wishes and needs of a person with dementia are, it is important to have a timely conversation about this so that it can be recorded in good time. The estimated last three months of life in the palliative phase is called the terminal phase. Good cooperation between professionals involved is important to make the last phase of life as smooth as possible.",
  "moretext2_9": "Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their loved ones dealing with a life-threatening condition by preventing and relieving suffering, through early detection and careful assessment and treatment of pain and other problems of a physical, psychosocial and spiritual nature.",
  "moretext2_10": "When the palliative phase starts, it is important to discuss wishes and needs about the last phase of life in a timely manner (advance care planning).",
  "moretext2_11": "On time in conversation",
  "moretext2_12": "Due to the long period of palliative care, most healthcare professionals find it difficult to start right away. Yet it is important as a professional to start the conversation about this in time. This is advance care planning, where you identify the wishes and needs of a person with dementia so that you can provide better care.",
  "moretext2_13": "Wishes and needs",
  "moretext2_14": "Advance care planning is important in persons with dementia. When a person with dementia is in an advanced stage, they can no longer always articulate their wishes and needs. By starting the conversation early in the dementia process, people are even better able to express what they would like around the end of life. It also ensures that in acute situations what can be done is already decided, making the GP's job easier.",
  "moretext2_15": "An important part in palliative care is communication with the client. For palliative care, there are a number of topics you should pay attention to. With these, you can contribute to the client's quality of life.",
  "moretext2_16": "Communication in palliative care is vital because it helps to understand and respect the needs, wishes and concerns of patients and their families. Effective communication enables healthcare providers to put the patient at the centre of the care process, support them in making decisions, manage their pain and symptoms and improve their quality of life. It also helps build trust and provide emotional support to the patient and their loved ones during this difficult period. In short, good communication contributes to a better palliative care experience for all involved.",
